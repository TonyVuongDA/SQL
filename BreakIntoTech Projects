--Spotify Data
-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
  track_name varchar NOT NULL,
  track_id varchar NOT NULL,
  popularity integer NOT NULL,
  danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
  energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
  key integer NOT NULL,
  loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
  mode integer NOT NULL,
  speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
  acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
  instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
  liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
  valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
  tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
  duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
  time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--What is the average popularity, danceability and energy by artist and track? 
SELECT
  artist_name,
  track_name,
  avg(popularity),
  avg(danceability),
  avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--Which artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms 
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--How many songs did each artist have?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) AS number_of_song
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY number_of_song DESC;

--CTE/Temp Tables:
--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
--Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, 
--show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS
